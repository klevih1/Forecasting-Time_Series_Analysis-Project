    "\n",
    "- **All-forecast overview**: compare the red forecast lines to the steelblue historical trend. Large gaps between the two highlight cities with stronger January shifts.\n",
    "- **Confidence intervals**: the shaded 80% and 95% bands show uncertainty. Wider bands indicate higher residual variance and lower day-to-day confidence.\n",
    "- **Detailed single-city panels**: look for abrupt slope changes at the train/forecast split (dashed line). Sudden changes suggest the model is extrapolating into a new regime.\n",
    "- **Zoom view (Oct\u2013Dec 2025 \u2192 Jan 2026)**: emphasizes short-term behavior. If the forecast is smooth relative to late-2025 volatility, the model may be underestimating spikes.\n",
    "- **Performance bar chart**: cities with higher MAE should be treated cautiously in downstream decisions. Pair those with wider CI bands.\n"
